CHANGELOG

v.8.1
Note: If you are upgrading from a version prior to 8.0, delete your ServerTools.bin file. Take note, this will wipe saved player data such as
/sethome locations and player command delays set by ServerTools. This will not effect inventory or anything in that regard
Note: HowToSetup.xml only generates on server startup
Note: If your output log reports a mistake while loading a file from ServerTools, it can sometimes be a simple issue with a file you have edited
or a mistake in the ServerTools config file itself. The output will let you know. If an error is detected, try to delete the file with your server
shutdown and restart. Check your output log at this time for any errors. Please report them to us so we can address it. Check HowToSetup.xml for 
a link to the Github page you can report bugs at or enter our discord and join the party
