When compiling your own version of ServerTools, direct your projects reference folder to the Binary folder provided with ServerTools.
Add all of the reference files to your project that are located in the Binary folder.
If you find anything missing, they should be located on your 7DTD dedicated server inside the folder named Managed.
If you are still unable to locate the required files to compile your own ServerTools, please contact the development team on Discord and Github.
